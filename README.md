# README for AI-Powered Hospitality Personalization Platform Prototype

## Overview

The AI-Powered Hospitality Personalization Platform prototype is an initial proof-of-concept designed to showcase the potential of machine learning solutions in the hospitality industry. The prototype emphasizes personalized guest experiences through two primary features: recommendation systems and sentiment analysis. This early version provides a baseline from which more advanced functionalities and integrations can be developed.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- **ai_platform.py**: The main entry point of the prototype. It orchestrates the functionalities of both the recommendation system and sentiment analysis, loading data files and printing results to the console.

- **recommendation_system.py**: Contains a simplistic recommendation system that uses guest data to suggest activities based on past preferences.

- **sentiment_analysis.py**: Implements a basic sentiment analysis feature that evaluates guest reviews to ascertain whether they are positive, negative, or neutral, using TextBlob for natural language processing.

- **requirements.txt**: Lists the Python dependencies necessary to run the prototype, specifically pandas for data handling and TextBlob for sentiment analysis.

- **data/**: A directory intended for data files used by the prototype, such as `guest_preferences.csv` and `sentiment_data.csv`. These CSV files should be populated with dummy or real data for testing.

## Getting Started

To set up and run the prototype, follow these steps:

1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.

2. **Install Dependencies**: Use the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the necessary Python libraries listed in `requirements.txt`.

3. **Prepare Data**: Populate the `guest_preferences.csv` and `sentiment_data.csv` files in the `data/` directory with appropriate data. This is essential for the recommendation and sentiment analysis features to function.

4. **Run the Prototype**: Execute `python ai_platform.py` from the command line to launch the prototype. The system will process the input data and output personalized recommendations and sentiment analysis results to the console.

## Future Development

This prototype is a starting point for further development. Potential enhancements include:

- **Machine Learning Models**: Integrate more sophisticated machine learning algorithms for improved guest preference prediction and sentiment analysis.

- **Scalability**: Adapt the prototype to handle larger datasets and integrate with existing hotel management systems.

- **Additional Features**: Expand to include features like dynamic pricing, virtual concierge services, and smart room management.

- **User Interface**: Develop a user-friendly interface for hotel staff and guests, providing real-time interaction with the personalization features.
